# VL.IO.Xbox360Controller
VL wrapper for DXSharp.XInput adding nodes for the Xbox 360 Controller

With this you can quickly add an extra layer of polish to your exported apps.

## Using the library
In order to use this library with vl you have to install the nuget that is available via nuget.org. For information on how to use nugets with VL, see [Managing Nugets](https://thegraybook.vvvv.org/reference/libraries/dependencies.html#manage-nugets) in the VL documentation. As described there you go to the commandline and then type:

    nuget install VL.IO.Xbox360Controller

Once the VL.IO.Xbox360Controller nuget is installed and referenced in your VL document you'll find nodes called Xbox360Controller in your node browser. Use those to read all the various inputs this controller provides.

For extra details on how to use this library, check out the included HowTo patch "Read Xbox 360 Controller inputs", available in the Help Browser (F1).
